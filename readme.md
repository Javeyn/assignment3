# Password Generator


## Second push

I decided to change up my code and write it out in a style that I felt more familiar with. The JavaScript feels really "wet" and in may cases I feel that a lot of the code could have been consolidated, I was just having a hard time remembering how.

At this point, I believe I have everything all dialed in to create a password based on their criteria, but for some reason I can't get the password to generate on screen. I am going to go back through my code and figure out how to display their password.


## First push

This is the first rendition of my password generator. Having missed
class on Monday after the long break, it was difficult to remember exactly HOW I would go about doing this. I will be working into the night to try to get this finished, but I wanted to at least submit something until I can get a more polished version to you guys.


### Thoughts

This project was definitely more difficult than the prior two, but I remember feeling the same way about HTML and CSS when I was submitting my first assignment and I feel much more comfortable with them now, so I know it is just a matter of those ABC's. 

This project and the week leading up to it has shown me some of the really neat things that we can do with JavaScript. Another neat bonus is that I can see where syntax and logic in JavaScript would be a fantastic way to get a taste of the same kinds of logical thinking that we will be needing as we move forward with the course. I am particularily excited about this because I want to try to make a very simple game, and the last week has shown me how something that we use in JavaScript would be just as useful when thinking in terms of game or app developement. 

But I digress. This is the first rendition of my password generator, more to come soon.
